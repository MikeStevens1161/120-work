The project has been so much fun for me. It is by far my favorite thing I've done for any class this yeah. I mean of coarse there were times I felt like throwing my computer aginst the wall out of frustration, but hey after hours of tutorial of tutorial videos on how to make this. I've got to say i love how it turned out. I can't wait for the next coding class. This is something I could enjoy for a long time to come. Oh for anyone checking this out spacebar to fire arrow keys to move around hope you enjoy. I know this is just a basic game and I could do a lot more work to improve it. But I'm happy where its at for now.

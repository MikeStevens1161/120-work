This week has been a bit of a challenge but I must say I've absolutly loved it.
I looking forward to all I'll be able to do with this animation. Wanting to go into video game designing
I can see where this stuff will come in handy. I think my biggest challenge this week was trying to find the time
to work on this project. If I did't have to study so much for ethics class I would have spent all my time on this project
I theroly enjoyed it and look forward to learning to apply this stuff with a 3D effect.

This weeks assignment was definatly what i would call fun. I must say that I found it easier move the shapes around without using translate because it didn't trought the quardinate math i was doing in my head. I can see where it would be usefull but i prefer not to. making a creature wasn't so bad. I look forward to seeing what else we can do. I poked around the web and some of all the other stuff that you can do with p5 looks fun i cant wait to get to it. This week i didn't have really any troube with what we were doing so i didn't have any issues i don't think i hade to make but one correction to my code and that was just simple spelling issue.

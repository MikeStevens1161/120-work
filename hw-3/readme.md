#Homework Response

This week for homework I found quite easy. I'm also taking intro to web design
and i must say that im absolulty loving creative coding so much more. It is so
much easier to understand simply because the teacher takes the time to make the
videos himself and shows what he wants done. I can honestly say i didn't find any
part of this weeks assignment hard to do and I look forward to what is to come next
week. This assignment didn't require anything but simply fallow the instructions
given in the videos. I particularly loved the extra bit on the index.html it helped
me undersand in ten minutes what intro to web design was trying to explain this past
week but couldn't grasp for some reason. The biggist thing i learned this week is
that i need to complete my creative coding class assignments before web development
assignments.
